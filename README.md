# Bellabeat Fitness Tracker EDA

I want to run an EDA to find which fitness metrics provide an opportunity for the Bellabeat marketing team to launch a new campaign based on how users interact with their smart watches/trackers.

## Description

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health habits.

The purpose of this study is to analyze non-Bellabeat smart device usage in order to gain insight into how consumers are already using their devices. For this case, we will apply our insights to the Bellabeat app, with possible applications for the Bellabeat Time watch.
